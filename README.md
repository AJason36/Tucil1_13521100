## **General Information**
24 game is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four cards so that the end result is 24. Playing cards consist of 4 symbols, Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Each symbol consist of 13 card: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. In ‘24’ game, we only care
about the value of the card, not the symbol. Ace has 1 value,
Jack has 11 values, Queen has 12 values, King has 13 values,
and numbers have value based on the number. Each cards can only be used exactly once. Only basic arithmetical operations can be used in this game, which are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
